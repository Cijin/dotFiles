# VimRc Config

### Updated on May 2021:
Git gutter
Indent lines

Relative lines

### Updated on 12 Jan 2021:
Now also includes the hyper config, figured I wouldn't be using one without the other.
Also the new font is just amazing with gruvebox theme for vimrc :)

### Major Re write on October 2023
Re-wrote everything in `lua`. Moved to lsp, removed a lot of plugins, down to a very few 
that I actually use on a daily basis. Moving to lsp was a great idea. Installation is much 
easier too.

## To install
* Install [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
* Go to plugins file run `:Packer sync`
* Done
